This is for a Data Journalism class at UC Berkeley.

I chose to create a column chart on responses to the question "Under normal circumstances, does a person who reclines their seat during a flight have any obligation to the person sitting behind them?" The data I used was drawn from the FiveThirtyEight Flying Etiquette data set provided to us in class. 

I opted to explore this question as it was one I've thought about several times in the past when I've taken airline flights. I personally often lean my seat back for longer flgihts when I need to sleep, as it is difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in otherwise. Moreover, I don't mind when the person in front of me leans their seat back, as I also know how uncomfortable it can be to not do so. My logic is further supported by the fact that leaning a seat back is even an option in the first place: Why engineer the seats with that purpose if you don't want people to use it. 

However, taking into consideration the response options imply the person behind you **asks you _not_ to recline your seat**, I would probably not recline my seat so as to not inconvenience another passenger. Although that is my personal view, I also acknowledge the line of thinking for _not_ having an "obligation" to the person sitting behind them: They paid for the flight and should be free to recline their seat if they'd like, given the aircraft is designed to include that option. Given the valid arguments for both ends of the spectrum — coupled with my preexisting curiosity on the matter — I thought it was pretty cool that this dataset surveyed responses to this question.

Upon creating my chart, I eliminated nonresponses, bringing the grand total of responses from 1,040 down to 854. Of the remaining responses, 543 people — or 63.6% — responded that they should not recline their chair if the person behind them asks them not to, and 311 people — or 36.4% — responded that the person has no obligation to the person behind them. I had assumed the results would be mixed, though I would've thought a bit more people would agree with my view that there is an obligation to others seated behind you.
